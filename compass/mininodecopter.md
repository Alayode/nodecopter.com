If you want to organize a nodecopter event as fast a possible, or are lacking
the [qualifications](/compass#qualifications) to put on a full event, you
should consider doing a **MiniNodeCopter**.

A **MiniNodeCopter** is just like a full NodeCopter event, except smaller. The
maximum size is for a MiniNodeCopter is:

* **5 teams** with a total of **15 people** (visitors not counted)
* **5 drones** (you can have spare drones so)

You still **need to register** your event with
[core@nodecopter.com](mailto:core@nodecopter.com), and you **should** have
attended a previous NodeCopter event, but you do not need oversight from a
previous organizer.

Another advantage of doing a **MiniNodeCopter** is that you will need to spend
significantly less time on raising money, promoting the event, finding a venue
and putting the whole thing together.
