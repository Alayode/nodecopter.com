Before having your NodeCopter event, you should follow these few steps to set
the drones up:

* install the FreeFlight app on [iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/free-flight/id373065271?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parrot.freeflight&hl=en) device
* Unbox every drone, check for damages
* Turn on the drone by putting the battery in
* Connect to the drone's WiFi with your smartphone
* open up the FreeFlight app

## Upgrade the firmware

* See if "AR.DRONE UPDATE" background is dark grey. If so, press it and upgrade the firmware of the drone
* wait for the restart and see if all four LEDs are green

## Rename the WiFi

* Go to "PILOTING"
* Go to settings (the little cog next to the battery status)
* Change to WiFi name to something meaningful
* Turn the drone off
* Put a sticker/label on the bottom of the drone with the WiFi name
