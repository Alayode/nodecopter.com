After organizing several NodeCopter events, we found it works best to follow a
rough schedule to make a NodeCopter day as much fun as possible.

The following is a suggested example schedule:

### 9.30am - Open The Doors

Let the attendees in so they can setup their workstations.

### 10am - Official Start & Introduction

As an organizer it's wise to give a short presentation (10-15min) about NodeCopter
and what's going to happen today. Experience has shown, that the following bullet
points should be explained in the presentation, so everybody can have fun:

* What is NodeCopter?
* What is an AR.Drone and how can I program it?
* How do I use the ar-drone module and get started?
* What's the schedule for the day? When is demo time?
* Links to the [NodeCopter guides](/guides)
* Show what's possible and already been done by pointing out the [modules](/modules) page
* Show the [list of ideas](/ideas) we've collected to give people some food for thought

### 10.15am - Forming Of Teams

Ask the attendees to form teams of 3-4 people. Help people without a team to join
an existing team.

Maybe offer [suggestions](/ideas) as to what the teams could hack on, which modules already
solved problems some teams are going to face, ask already formed teams if they
already have an idea of what they will do and maybe get attendees without a team
interested.

### 10.30am - Start hacking!

Hand out the drones to the teams and **let the hacking begin!**

### 1pm - Lunchtime

Time to offer a break between all the hacking and the flying robots. Check out
the [Drinks And Lunch](compass/budget#drinks-and-lunch) part of the budget
compass as to how to pull this off.

### 6pm - The Final: Drinks & Demos

Tell the teams that the day is coming to a close. If a teams wants to demonstrate
what they were working on that day, they have the floor and can show off what
crazy stuff their drone can do!

Experience has shown that it's best to only allow visitors for the demo time. Having
visitors before that usually interrupts the focus of the hacking groups.
