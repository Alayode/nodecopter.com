<h2 id="organize-introduction"><a href="#organize-introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

The following material was written to serve as *guidelines* for organizing your own NodeCopter event.
These are experiences from past NodeCopter events - abiding by these guidelines should put you in a good position to host an event that your attendees and you yourself will like.

However, you are free to organize your event any way you like. There are only a few <a href="#qualifications">qualifications</a> that you must abide by.

<h2 id="qualifications"><a href="#qualifications">Qualifications</a></h2>

In order to organize an event using the NodeCopter name and brand for the first
time, you must follow these steps:

1. Get at least one person with experience organizing events. In the best
   case it's someone who has already attended or organized a NodeCopter event.
2. Read all the information on this page.
3. **Send an email** to [core@nodecopter.com](mailto:core@nodecopter.com) to
   discuss your event *before* announcing it.

<h2 id="values"><a href="#values">Core Values</a></h2>

Anybody organizing a NodeCopter event should agree with this:

* NodeCopter is a **community event** (affordable & inclusive).
* NodeCopter is **non-profit** (all money goes into the events).
* NodeCopter is about **learning**, **sharing**, **fun** and **being nice to each other**.

<h2 id="budget"><a href="#budget">Budget</a></h2>

There are essentially four big items that you need to budget for:

* [Venue](#budget-venue) (0 - 5000 USD)
* [Drinks and lunch](#budget-drinks-and-lunch) (25 - 50 USD / person)
* [Drones and parts](#budget-drones-and-parts) (~500 USD / drone)
* [Travel and lodging](#budget-travel-and-lodging) (0 - 5000 USD)

Additionally you should add an extra ~15% to your budget for overhead:

* Unexpected problems
* Power splitters
* Shipping drones to drone sponsors
* Extra drinks for visitors in the evening
* etc.

If you want a quick estimate, check our [example budget](#budget-example).

<h3 id="budget-venue"><a href="#budget-venue">Venue</a></h3>

Ideally you can find a local company to provide a [nice venue](#venue)
for free.

If you cannot find a free venue, you should:

* Look at different venues and compare prices
* Be prepared to spend some money (100 - 5000 USD is usually enough)
* Try to get a discount for doing something amazing

Some venues may also like the idea of people taking photos & videos of their
venue from positions & angles that are only reachable with the drones.

If you need money to pay for your venue, you need to find [sponsors](#sponsors).

<h3 id="budget-drinks-and-lunch"><a href="#budget-drinks-and-lunch">Drinks and lunch</a></h3>

To let people focus on programming the drones, you should provide drinks
(water, soft drinks, maybe beer in the evening) and lunch.

You can do this in one of two ways:

* Buy food & drinks from the venue: This will most likely be more expensive,
  but easier to coordinate and some venues will require it.
* **Recommended:** Buy drinks & order delivery food yourself. This is
  cheaper and more flexible, but requires a little more work.

Your [ticket price](#tickets) should be set to exactly cover the drinks
and food. Make sure you keep VAT / sales tax in mind when calculating this.

<h3 id="budget-drones-and-parts"><a href="#budget-drones-and-parts">Drones and parts</a></h3>

In order to have a great day, you will want to ensure there are enough
batteries, chargers and repair parts to provide a smooth experience.

For this reason you want to have:

* 2 extra chargers & batteries per drone
* A few backup drones (20% extra drones is a good number)
* Repair parts

While Parrot is selling all drone parts that are required to build a drone
from scratch, you should only buy these parts:

* Propellers (buy 1 pack for every ~3 drones)
* Gears & Shafts (buy 1 pack for every ~3 drones)
* Adhesive kit (buy 1 pack for every ~3 drones)
* Motors (buy 1 for every ~10 drones)
* Central Cross (buy 1 for every ~10 drones)
* Screws (buy 1 pack total)
* Mounting Tools (buy 2 total)

You can also buy other parts, but please consider:

* The other parts are very expensive. Building a drone from parts costs
  almost twice as much as buying an assembled one.
* In our experience only the parts listed above break frequently.

Please refer to the [purchase](#purchase) section regarding tips for
buying your drones and parts.

<h3 id="budget-example"><a href="#budget-example">Example Budget</a></h3>

To give you an idea of what the total budget for an event could look like,
here is an example for a NodeCopter with 30 people:

* **Lunch:** 30 x 15 USD = **450 USD**
* **Drinks:** 42 x 15 USD = **630 USD** (including 12 visitors)
* **Drones:** 8 x 300 USD = **2400 USD** (+4 existing drones)
* **Extra Batteries:** 24 x 40 USD = **960 USD**
* **Extra Chargers:** 24 x 40 USD = **960 USD**
* **Repair Parts:** 1 x 200 USD = **200 USD**

**Total:** 5600 USD (hard costs) + 990 USD (15% overhead) = **6590 USD**

This is just an example, but **2500 USD - 10000 USD** is a reasonable ball
bark for most NodeCopter events.

But don't be scared, just read the [financing](#financing) part of this page
to see how you can pull this off.

<h2 id="financing"><a href="#financing">Financing</a></h2>

As you have seen in the [example budget](#budget-example), putting on
a NodeCopter event will typically cost **2500 - 10000 USD**.

Here is how you can raise money for your event:

* [Finding Sponsors](#financing-finding-sponsors)
* [Using Existing Drones](#financing-using-existing-drones)

<h3 id="financing-finding-sponsors"><a href="#financing-finding-sponsors">Finding Sponsors</a></h3>
Ask local (or not-so-local) tech companies if they want to sponsor your event.
Try to offer them attractive sponsoring packages so they can get some value from
sponsoring a NodeCopter event. Packages may look like the following:

* Sponsor a drone that you will receive after the event. The drone will have your
  name and sticker on it during the event.
* Sponsor the venue! If you have a large office with high ceilings it would be great
  to use it for a NodeCopter event!
* Sponsor more than a drone and get your name and logo on the event specific website,
  your banner put up at the venue and some free swag for every attendee.

<h3 id="financing-using-existing-drones"><a href="#financing-using-existing-drones">Using Existing Drones</a></h3>
Ask around in your local tech scene (or attendees!) if someone already has an AR.Drone they can provide
for the event. This way you can lower the amount of drones that you have to buy. Make sure to also buy spare parts and
batteries for drones that other people bring, because breaking and not fixing someone else's drone is not cool.

<h2 id="venue"><a href="#venue">Venue</a></h2>

A venue for a NodeCopter event should ideally meet the following requirements:


* **Stable WiFi**: This one is very important as it can ruin your event. On average every attendee has two WiFi-capable devices (computer, phone, tablet, ...). Be sure your venue's WiFi can handle this! Every drone will also open its own wi-fi, so there might be a lot of Wifi-interference, causing them to not work properly. You should have a big enough room to accommodate for your amount of drones.

* **Floor**: This one is also very important, as it affects the way drones fly. Your floor should have a clear texture. If it hasn't, drones cannot analyze how high they are, etc. If you have a very homogenous floor, use tape (e.g. masking tape) to give it a texture. Ideally there shouldn't be a carpet, as they usually have a bad impact on the
  ultrasonic sensors the drones use.

* **Flying area**: A separate flying area is great to play
  around with drones, try out the programs and should prevent drones from
  crashing into people.

* **High ceiling**: A flying area with a low ceiling doesn't make a lot of sense
  when there are programmed NodeCopters flying around. Ideal would be a minimum
  height of 4 meters (13 feet).

* **Great hacking space**: Attendees are going to program their drones, so be
  sure to provide an area where they can sit down and hack.

* **Electricity**: Make sure there are enough power sockets and power splitters.
  People need to recharge their computers and their phones, and you need to hook
  up the rechargers for the batteries somewhere. You don't want to run out of fully
  charged batteries when people are doing crazy stuff with their drones!

* **Projector and screen**: For the introductory talk at the beginning of a
  NodeCopter event a projector and a screen are really great. And when it's time
  for the demos most attendees will need a projector to show off what they built.

In general it's recommended to bring your drone to the venue beforehand and do
some test flights.

<h3 id="venue-berlin"><a href="#venue-berlin">Example: Berlin</a></h3>

<img src="/img/venue-small.jpg" alt="NodeCopter Berlin Venue">

**Pro**:

* The abandoned public swimming baths were **huge**! There was plenty of space
  to fly around!
* The hacking area was totally separated from the flying area: attendees were
  sitting besides the empty pool in which the drones where flying.

**Contra**:

* The electricity in that old building wasn't the best. We essentially had a
  couple of power sockets and needed loads of power splitters to make this work.

* It was cold since it takes a lot of time and effort to heat up such a huge
  hall at the beginning of October.

<h3 id="venue-dublin"><a href="#venue-dublin">Example: Dublin</a></h3>

<img src="/img/dublin-venue-small.jpg" alt="NodeCopter Dublin Venue">

**Pro**:

* The hacking spaces were really comfortable: you had a choice between
  working at a normal desk or sitting on a couch.

* Separate flying and hacking areas.

**Contra**:

* Even though the venue had high ceilings it also had some metal bars on the
  ceilings, which a lot of NodeCopters hit eventually.


<h2 id="tickets"><a href="#tickets">Tickets</a></h2>
Since NodeCopter events are events for the community and not for profit the ticket
prices for an event should be used to cover the costs only.

Try to get sponsors and other financing first and then set the ticket price so you
can cover the rest of the costs (food and drinks).

Most NodeCopter events charge **25 - 50 USD** for a ticket, depending on the size
of the event. That's a good range for ticket prices and doesn't harm the community
spirit of NodeCopter.

We can recommend using [tito.io](https://tito.io) for selling the
tickets to your NodeCopter event.

<h2 id="purchase"><a href="#purchase">Purchase</a></h2>
The easiest way to purchase drones is by using Amazon in your country. They should
have the drones and spare parts in stock.

An even better option would be to search for local distributors of AR.Drones and
see if you can buy some drones for non-retail prices. Make sure to tell them that
the drones are not intended for resale and used for a non-profit community event!

<h2 id="setup-drones"><a href="#setup-drones">Setup the drones</a></h2>
Before having your NodeCopter event, you should follow these few steps to set
up the drones:

* install the FreeFlight app on [iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/free-flight/id373065271?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parrot.freeflight&hl=en) device
* Unbox every drone, check for damages
* Turn on the drone by putting the battery in
* Connect to the drone's WiFi with your smartphone
* open up the FreeFlight app

<h3 id="setup-drones-upgrade-firmware"><a href="#setup-drones-upgrade-firmware">Upgrade the firmware</a></h3>

* See if "AR.DRONE UPDATE" background is dark grey. If so, press it and upgrade the firmware of the drone
* Wait for the restart and see if all four LEDs are green

<h3 id="setup-drones-rename-wifi"><a href="#setup-drones-rename-wifi">Rename the Wi-Fi</a></h3>

* Go to "PILOTING"
* Go to settings (the little cog next to the battery status)
* Change WiFi name to something meaningful
* Turn the drone off
* Put a sticker/label on the bottom of the drone with the WiFi name

<h2 id="setup-venue"><a href="#setup-venue">Setup the Venue</a></h2>

Some tips on setting up the venue:

<h3 id="setup-venue-repair-station"><a href="#setup-venue-repair-station">Have a battery/repair station</a></h3>

Set a table aside which you'll use a battery charging station, repair station
and question station. That way you have one place where the attendees can get fresh batteries, repair the drones and ask questions.

<h3 id="setup-venue-flying-area"><a href="#setup-venue-flying-area">Have a separate flying area</a></h3>

In order to prevent accidents create a separate flying area. That way you won't
have drones crashing into humans or laptops.

<h3 id="setup-venue-hacking-tables"><a href="#setup-venue-hacking-tables">Setup the hacking tables</a></h3>

Setup the tables in a way that a team of 3 to 4 hackers has enough space to
have a drone on the table and their laptops. Have enough power sockets available
for each table, since every attendee probably has one laptop and one mobile
device that need recharging. Don't separate teams too much, because sharing and
exchange is a big part of a successful NodeCopter event.

<h3 id="setup-venue-general"><a href="#setup-venue-general">General</a></h3>

Make sure you know your way around the venue, so you can answer organizational questions like where drinks, toilets and the smoking area are.

<h2 id="schedule"><a href="#schedule">Schedule</a></h2>

After organizing several NodeCopter events, we found it works best to follow a
rough schedule to make a NodeCopter day as much fun as possible.

The following is a suggested example schedule:

<h3 id="schedule-open-doors"><a href="#schedule-open-doors">9.30am - Open The Doors</a></h3>

Let the attendees in so they can setup their workstations and find teams.

<h3 id="schedule-intro"><a href="#schedule-intro">10am - Official Start & Introduction</a></h3>

As an organizer it's wise to give a short presentation (10-15min) about NodeCopter
and what's going to happen today. Experience has shown, that the following bullet
points should be explained in the presentation, so everybody can have fun:

* What is NodeCopter?
* What is an AR.Drone and how can I program it?
* How do I use the ar-drone module and get started?
* What's the schedule for the day? When is demo time?
* Links to the [NodeCopter guides](/guides)
* Show what's possible and already been done by pointing out the [modules](/modules) page
* Show the [list of ideas](/ideas) we've collected to give people some food for thought

<h3 id="schedule-teams"><a href="#schedule-teams">10.15am - Forming Of Teams</a></h3>

Ask the attendees to form teams of 3-4 people. Help people without a team to join
an existing team.

Maybe offer [suggestions](/ideas) as to what the teams could hack on, which modules already
solved problems some teams are going to face, ask already formed teams if they
already have an idea of what they will do and maybe get attendees without a team
interested.

<h3 id="schedule-start"><a href="#schedule-start">10.30am - Start hacking!</a></h3>

Hand out the drones to the teams and **let the hacking begin!**

<h3 id="schedule-lunchtime"><a href="#schedule-lunchtime">1pm - Lunchtime</a></h3>

Time to offer a break between all the hacking and the flying robots. Check out
the [Drinks And Lunch](#budget-drinks-and-lunch) part to see how to pull this off.

<h3 id="schedule-drinks-demos"><a href="#schedule-drinks-demos">6pm - The Final: Drinks & Demos</a></h3>

Tell the teams that the day is coming to a close. If a team wants to demonstrate
what they were working on that day, they have the stage and can show off what
crazy stuff their drone can do!

Experience has shown that it's best to only allow visitors for the demo time. Having
visitors before that usually interrupts the focus of the hacking groups.

<h2 id="mininodecopter"><a href="#mininodecopter">MiniNodeCopter</a></h2>

If you want to organize a NodeCopter event as fast a possible, or are lacking
the [qualifications](#qualifications) to put on a full event, you
should consider doing a **MiniNodeCopter**.

A **MiniNodeCopter** is just like a full NodeCopter event, except smaller. The
maximum size is for a MiniNodeCopter is:

* **5 teams** with a total of **15 people** (visitors not counted)
* **5 drones** (you can have spare drones)

You still **need to register** your event with
[core@nodecopter.com](mailto:core@nodecopter.com), and you **should** have
attended a previous NodeCopter event.

Another advantage of doing a **MiniNodeCopter** is that you will need to spend
significantly less time on raising money, promoting the event, finding a venue
and putting the whole thing together.
