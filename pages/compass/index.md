In order to organize an event using the nodecopter name and brand for the first
time, you must follow these steps:

1. **Attend** at least one nodecopter event.
2. **Get** at least one existing organizer to provide oversight.
3. **Read** all information on these pages.
4. **Send an email** to [new@nodecopter.com](mailto:new-events@nodecopter.com) to
  discuss your event **before** announcing it.

Any event not coordinated with us must not call itself nodecopter and will
receive no support from the nodecopter network of volunteers.
