<h2 id="venue"><a href="#venue">Venue</a></h2>

A venue for a NodeCopter event should ideally meet the following requirements:

* **Flying area**: a separate flying area is great to play
  around with drones, try out the programs and should prevent drones from
  crashing into people.

* **Great hacking space**: attendees are going to program their drones, so be
  sure to provide an area where they can sit down and hack.

* **Stable WiFi**: it's safe to say that there will be on average a minimum
  of two WiFi-capable devices per attendee (computer, phone, tablet, ...). And
  every drone that is powered on will open its own wi-fi. Be sure your venue's
  WiFi can handle this!

* **Electricity**: Be sure there are enough power sockets and enough power splitters
  so you can hook up the rechargers for the batteries. You don't want to run out of fully
  charged batteries when people are doing crazy stuff with their drones!

* **Projector and screen**: For the introductory talk at the beginning of a
  NodeCopter event a projector and a screen are really great. And when it's time
  for the demos most attendes will need a projector to show of what they build.
