<h2 id="budget"><a href="#budget">Budget</a></h2>

There are essentially 3 big items that you need to budget for:

* Venue
* Drinks and Food
* Drones, extra chargers, extra batteries and repair parts

Additionally you may want to have some additional budget for:

* Unexpected problems
* Power splitters
* etc.

## Venue

Ideally you can find a local company to provide a [nice venue](/venue) for free.
