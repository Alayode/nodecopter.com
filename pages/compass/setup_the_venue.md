Some tips on setting up the venue:

### Have a battery/repair station

Set a table aside which you'll use a battery charging station, repair station
and question station. That way you have one place where the attendees go to, to
get fresh batteries, repairing the drones and ask questions

### Have a separate flying area

To prevent accidents create a separate flying area where. That way you won't
have drones crashing into humans or laptops.

### Setup the hacking tables

Setup the tables in a way, that a team of 3 to 4 hackers has enough space to have
a drone on the table and their laptops. Provide enough power supply available on
each table. Don't separate teams too much, because sharing and exchange is a big
part of a successful NodeCopter event.

### General

Make sure you know your way around the venue, so you can answer the questions on
where stuff like the drinks, the toilets and the smoking area is.
