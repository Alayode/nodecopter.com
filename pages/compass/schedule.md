After organizing several Nodecopter events, we found it works best to follow a rough schedule to make a Nodecopter day as much fun as possible.
The following is a suggested example schedule:

### 9.30am - Open The Doors
Let the attendees in so they can setup their workstations.

### 10am - Official Start & Introduction
As an organizer it's wise to give a short presentation (10-15min) about Nodecopter and what's going to happen today. Experience has shown, that the following bullet points should be explained in the presentation, so everybody can have fun:

* What is Nodecopter?
* What is an AR.Drone and how can I program it?
* How do I use the ar-drone module and get started?
* What's the schedule for the day? When is demo time?
* Links to the [Nodecopter guides](/guides)
* Show what's possible and already been done by pointing out the [modules](/modules) page

### 10.15am - Forming Of Teams
Ask the attendees to form teams of 3-4 people. Help people without a team to join an existing team.

Maybe offer suggestions as to what the teams could hack on, which modules already solved problems some teams are going to face, ask already formed teams if they already have an idea of what they will do and maybe get attendees without a team interested.

### 10.30am - Start hacking!
Hand out the drones to the teams and **let the hacking begin!**

### 1pm - Lunchtime
Time to offer a break between all the hacking and the flying robots. Check out the [Drinks And Lunch](compass/budget#drinks-and-lunch) part of the budget compass as to how to pull this off.

### 6pm - The Finale: Drinks & Demos
Tell the teams that the day is coming to a close. If a teams wants to demonstrate what they were working on that day, they have the floor and can show off what crazy stuff their drone can do!
