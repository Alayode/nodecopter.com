<h2 id="qualifications"><a href="#qualifications">Qualifications</a></h2>

In order to organize an event using the nodecopter name and brand, you must
follow these steps:

1. **Attend** at least one nodecopter event (or get support from at least one
  [core copter](/core) team member).
2. **Read** all information on these pages.
3. **Send an email** to [new@nodecopter.com](mailto:new-events@nodecopter.com) to
  discuss your event **before** announcing it.

Any event not coordinated with us must not call itself nodecopter and will
receive no support from the nodecopter network of volunteers.

Anybody organizing an event should agree with this:

* NodeCopter is a **community event** (affordable & inclusive)
* NodeCopter is **non-profit** (all money goes into the event itself)
* NodeCopter is about **learning**, **sharing** and **fun** (be nice)
