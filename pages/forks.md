<h2 id="forks"><a href="#forks">Forks</a></h2>

Just like open source software, the nodecopter movement and events can be
forked.

While exceptions may be made, forks are generally seen as separate events,
this means they:

* Use their own name, logo and website
* Follow their own rules
* Find their own sponsors
* Buy their own drones and equipment
* Create their own photos, videos, etc.

However, forks are free to:

* Use the nodecopter code and libraries
* Refer to themselves as a nodecopter fork
* Collaborate and exchange contacts, ideas, etc.

We generally prefer to incoporate new ideas and approaches, so please [get in
touch](mailto:core@nodecopter.com) before considering to fork.

The [Drone Olympics](http://droneolympics.com/) are a fork created by [Chris
Sanz](https://twitter.com/csanz). Differences to NodeCopter include:

* High profile judges
* Hand picked participants
* Coporate involvement
