<h2 id="qualifications"><a href="#qualifications">Qualifications</a></h2>

In order to organize an event using the nodecopter name and brand for the first
time, you must follow these steps:

1. **Attend** at least one nodecopter event.
2. **Get** at least one person with experience organizing events.
3. **Read** all information on these pages.
4. **Send an email** to [core@nodecopter.com](mailto:core@nodecopter.com) to
  discuss your event **before** announcing it.

Any event not coordinated with us must not call itself nodecopter and
will receive no support from the nodecopter network of volunteers.

<h2 id="values"><a href="#values">Core Values</a></h2>

Anybody organizing an event should agree with this:

* NodeCopter is a **community event** (affordable & inclusive)
* NodeCopter is **non-profit** (all money goes into the events)
* NodeCopter is about **learning**, **sharing** and **fun** (be nice)

To ensure that all events follow these values, the [core copter](/core) team
provides benevolent dictatorship for all events.

<h2 id="budget"><a href="#budget">Budget</a></h2>

There are essentially four big items that you need to budget for:

* [Venue](#budget-venue) (0 - 5000 USD)
* [Drinks and lunch](#budget-drinks-and-lunch) (25 - 50 USD / person)
* [Drones and parts](#budget-drones-and-parts) (~500 USD / drone)
* [Travel and lodging](#budget-travel-and-lodging) (0 - 5000 USD)

Additionally you should add an extra ~15% to your budget for overhead:

* Unexpected problems
* Power splitters
* Shipping drones to drone sponsors
* Extra drinks for visitors in the evening
* etc.

If you want a quick estimate, check our [example budget](#budget-example).

<h3 id="budget-venue"><a href="#budget-venue">Venue</a></h3>

Ideally you can find a local company to provide a [nice venue](#venue)
for free.

If you can not find a free venue, you should:

* Look at many different venues and compare prices
* Be prepared to spend 500 - 5000 USD
* Try to get a discount for doing something amazing

Some venues may also like the idea of people taking photos & videos of their
venue from positions & angles that are only reachable with the drones.

If you need money to pay for your venue, you need to find [sponsors](#sponsors).

<h3 id="budget-drinks-and-lunch"><a href="#budget-drinks-and-lunch">Drinks and lunch</a></h3>

To let people focus on programming the drones, you should provide drinks
(water, soft drinks, maybe beer in the evening) and lunch.

You can do this in one of two ways:

* Buy food & drinks from the venue: This will most likely be more expensive,
  but it easier to coordinate and some venues will require it.
* **Recommended:** Buy drinks & order delivery food yourself: This is is
  cheaper and more flexible, but requires a little more work.

Your [ticket price](#tickets) should be set to exactly cover the drinks
and food. Make sure you keep VAT / sales tax in mind when calculating this.

<h3 id="budget-drones-and-parts"><a href="#budget-drones-and-parts">Drones and parts</a></h3>

In order to have a great day, you will want to ensure there are enough
batteries, chargers and repair parts to provide a smooth experience.

For this reason you want to have:

* 2 extra chargers & batteries per drone
* A few backup drones (20% extra drones is a good number)
* Repair parts

While Parrot is selling all drone parts that are required to build a drone
from scratch, you should only buy these parts:

* Propellers (buy 1 pack for every ~3 drones)
* Gears & Shafts (buy 1 pack for every ~3 drones)
* Adhesive kit (buy 1 pack for every ~3 drones)
* Motors (buy 1 for every ~10 drones)
* Central Cross (buy 1 for every ~10 drones)
* Screws (buy 1 pack total)
* Mounting Tools (buy 2 total)

You can also buy other parts, but please consider:

* The other parts are very expensive, building a drone from parts costs
  almost twice as much as buying an assembled one.
* Only the parts listed above break frequently in our experience.

Please refer to the [purchase](#purchase) section regarding tips for
buying your drones and parts.

<h3 id="budget-travel-and-lodging"><a href="budget-travel-and-lodging">Travel and Lodging</a></h3>

Your event should pay travel and lodging for:

* Your overseeing organizer (you need one if this is your first event)
* [Core copter](/core) members, if one of them wants to attend

This is a gentlemen's agreement, so exceptions can be made depending
on your budget and circumstances.

<h3 id="budget-example"><a href="#budget-example">Example Budget</a></h3>

To give you an idea of what the total budget for an event could look like,
here is an example for a nodecopter with <%= people %> people:

* **Lunch:** 30 x 15 USD = **450 USD**
* **Drinks:** 42 x 15 USD = **630 USD** (including 12 visitors)
* **Drones:** 8 x 300 USD = **2400 USD** (+4 existing drones)
* **Extra Batteries:** 24 x 40 USD = **960 USD**
* **Extra Chargers:** 24 x 40 USD = **960 USD**
* **Repair Parts:** 1 x 200 USD = **200 USD**
* **Travel + lodging:** 1 x 1000 USD = **1000 USD**

**Total:** 6600 USD (hard costs) + 990 USD (15% overhead) = **7590 USD**

This is just an example, but **2500 USD - 10000 USD** is a reasonable ball
bark for most nodecopter events.

But don't be scared, just head over to the [financing](#financing) page
to see how you can pull this off.

<h2 id="financing"><a href="#financing">Financing</a></h2>

As you have seen in the [example budget](#budget-example), putting on
a nodecopter event will typically cost **2500 - 10000 USD**.

We are actively working on bringing these costs down by creating a base stock
of drones in North America and Europe, but for now, here is how you can raise
money for your event:

* [Selling Tickets](#financing-selling-tickets)
* [Finding Sponsors](#financing-finding-sponsors)

Additionally you can lower the costs of your event by:

* [Using Existing Drones](#financing-using-existing-drones)
* [Negotiating Discounts](#financing-negotiating-discounts)

<h2 id="venue"><a href="#venue">Venue</a></h2>

A venue for a NodeCopter event should ideally meet the following requirements:

* **Flying area**: a separate flying area is great to play
  around with drones, try out the programs and should prevent drones from
  crashing into people.

* **High ceiling**: a flying area with a low ceiling doesn't make a lot of sense
  when there are programmed NodeCopters flying around. Ideal would be a minimum
  height of 4 meters (13 feet).

* **Great hacking space**: attendees are going to program their drones, so be
  sure to provide an area where they can sit down and hack.

* **Stable WiFi**: it's safe to say that there will be on average a minimum
  of two WiFi-capable devices per attendee (computer, phone, tablet, ...). And
  every drone that is powered on will open its own wi-fi. Be sure your venue's
  WiFi can handle this!

* **Electricity**: be sure there are enough power sockets and enough power splitters.
  People need to recharge their computers and their phones, and you need to hook
  up the rechargers for the batteries somewhere. You don't want to run out of fully
  charged batteries when people are doing crazy stuff with their drones!

* **Projector and screen**: for the introductory talk at the beginning of a
  NodeCopter event a projector and a screen are really great. And when it's time
  for the demos most attendees will need a projector to show of what they built.

* **Floor**: To avoid drifting, your floor should have a clear texture. If you
  have a very homogenous floor, use tape (e.g. masking tape) to give it a texture.
  Ideally there shouldn't be a carpet, as they usually have a bad impact on the
  ultrasonic sensors the drones use.

In general it's recommended to bring your drone to the venue beforehand and do
some test flights.

<h3 id="venue-berlin"><a href="#venue-berlin">Example: Berlin</a></h3>

<img src="/img/venue-small.jpg" alt="NodeCopter Berlin Venue">

**Pro**:

* The abandoned public swimming baths were **huge**! There was plenty of space
  to fly around!
* The hacking area was totally separated from the flying area: attendees were
  sitting besides the empty pool in which the drones where flying.

**Contra**:

* The electricity in that old building wasn't the best. We essentially had a
  couple of power sockets and needed loads of power splitters to make this work.

* It was cold since it takes a lot of time and effort to heat up such a huge
  hall at the beginning of October.

<h3 id="venue-dublin"><a href="#venue-dublin">Example: Dublin</a></h3>

<img src="/img/dublin-venue-small.jpg" alt="NodeCopter Dublin Venue">

**Pro**:

* The hacking spaces were really comfortable: you had a choice between
  working at a normal desk or sitting on a couch.

* Separate flying and hacking areas.

**Contra**:

* Even though the venue had high ceilings it also had some metal bars on the
  ceilings, which a lot of NodeCopters hit eventually.

<h2 id="setup-drones"><a href="#setup-drones">Setup the drones</a></h2>
Before having your NodeCopter event, you should follow these few steps to set
the drones up:

* install the FreeFlight app on [iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/free-flight/id373065271?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parrot.freeflight&hl=en) device
* Unbox every drone, check for damages
* Turn on the drone by putting the battery in
* Connect to the drone's WiFi with your smartphone
* open up the FreeFlight app

<h3 id="setup-drones-upgrade-firmware"><a href="#setup-drones-upgrade-firmware">Upgrade the firmware</a></h3>

* See if "AR.DRONE UPDATE" background is dark grey. If so, press it and upgrade the firmware of the drone
* wait for the restart and see if all four LEDs are green

<h3 id="setup-drones-rename-wifi"><a href="#setup-drones-rename-wifi">Rename the Wi-Fi</a></h3>

* Go to "PILOTING"
* Go to settings (the little cog next to the battery status)
* Change to WiFi name to something meaningful
* Turn the drone off
* Put a sticker/label on the bottom of the drone with the WiFi name


<h2 id="setup-venue"><a href="#setup-venue">Setup the Venue</a></h2>

Some tips on setting up the venue:

<h3 id="setup-venue-repair-station"><a href="#setup-venue-repair-station">Have a battery/repair station</a></h3>

Set a table aside which you'll use a battery charging station, repair station
and question station. That way you have one place where the attendees can go to, to
get fresh batteries, repair the drones and ask questions.

<h3 id="setup-venue-flying-area"><a href="#setup-venue-flying-area">Have a separate flying area</a></h3>

In order prevent accidents create a separate flying area. That way you won't
have drones crashing into humans or laptops.

<h3 id="setup-venue-hacking-tables"><a href="#setup-venue-hacking-tables">Setup the hacking tables</a></h3>

Setup the tables in a way, that a team of 3 to 4 hackers has enough space to
have a drone on the table and their laptops. Have enough power sockets available
for each table, since every attendee probably has one laptop and one mobile
device that need recharging. Don't separate teams too much, because sharing and
exchange is a big part of a successful NodeCopter event.

<h3 id="setup-venue-general"><a href="#setup-venue-general">General</a></h3>

Make sure you know your way around the venue, so you can answer the questions on
where stuff like the drinks, the toilets and the smoking area is.

<h2 id="schedule"><a href="#schedule">Schedule</a></h2>

After organizing several NodeCopter events, we found it works best to follow a
rough schedule to make a NodeCopter day as much fun as possible.

The following is a suggested example schedule:

<h3 id="schedule-open-doors"><a href="#schedule-open-doors">9.30am - Open The Doors</a></h3>

Let the attendees in so they can setup their workstations.

<h3 id="schedule-intro"><a href="#schedule-intro">10am - Official Start & Introduction</a></h3>

As an organizer it's wise to give a short presentation (10-15min) about NodeCopter
and what's going to happen today. Experience has shown, that the following bullet
points should be explained in the presentation, so everybody can have fun:

* What is NodeCopter?
* What is an AR.Drone and how can I program it?
* How do I use the ar-drone module and get started?
* What's the schedule for the day? When is demo time?
* Links to the [NodeCopter guides](/guides)
* Show what's possible and already been done by pointing out the [modules](/modules) page
* Show the [list of ideas](/ideas) we've collected to give people some food for thought

<h3 id="schedule-teams"><a href="#schedule-teams">10.15am - Forming Of Teams</a></h3>

Ask the attendees to form teams of 3-4 people. Help people without a team to join
an existing team.

Maybe offer [suggestions](/ideas) as to what the teams could hack on, which modules already
solved problems some teams are going to face, ask already formed teams if they
already have an idea of what they will do and maybe get attendees without a team
interested.

<h3 id="schedule-start"><a href="#schedule-start">10.30am - Start hacking!</a></h3>

Hand out the drones to the teams and **let the hacking begin!**

<h3 id="schedule-lunchtime"><a href="#schedule-lunchtime">1pm - Lunchtime</a></h3>

Time to offer a break between all the hacking and the flying robots. Check out
the [Drinks And Lunch](#budget-drinks-and-lunch) part to see how to pull this off.

<h3 id="schedule-drinks-demos"><a href="#schedule-drinks-demos">6pm - The Final: Drinks & Demos</a></h3>

Tell the teams that the day is coming to a close. If a teams wants to demonstrate
what they were working on that day, they have the floor and can show off what
crazy stuff their drone can do!

Experience has shown that it's best to only allow visitors for the demo time. Having
visitors before that usually interrupts the focus of the hacking groups.

<h2 id="mininodecopter"><a href="#mininodecopter">MiniNodeCopter</a></h2>

If you want to organize a nodecopter event as fast a possible, or are lacking
the [qualifications](#qualifications) to put on a full event, you
should consider doing a **MiniNodeCopter**.

A **MiniNodeCopter** is just like a full NodeCopter event, except smaller. The
maximum size is for a MiniNodeCopter is:

* **5 teams** with a total of **15 people** (visitors not counted)
* **5 drones** (you can have spare drones so)

You still **need to register** your event with
[core@nodecopter.com](mailto:core@nodecopter.com), and you **should** have
attended a previous NodeCopter event, but you do not need oversight from a
previous organizer.

Another advantage of doing a **MiniNodeCopter** is that you will need to spend
significantly less time on raising money, promoting the event, finding a venue
and putting the whole thing together.
