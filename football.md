We're putting on a Nodecopter Football tournament!

Each game will be 1v1 match lasting 2 minutes.

There will be a knockout tournament consisting of 32 teams.

We have game pads you can use to control your drone or build your own software to control it.

The winning team will get some amazing [Prizes](https://gist.github.com/kwhinnery/52aac1a63553e841e7f7) sponsored by [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
